# DS-Programs

For this assignment, I chose to do programs 2-6. 
I will admit, I had a bit of difficulty with some of it, going to both the textbook and ChatGPT for advisement on how to proceed in ceratin areas. 
This was the only time I have been given an actual coding assignment by one of my computer science classes this semester, so I did struggle some, as I had gotten a bit rusty. 

Regardless, each of the files here should easily compile on anything that runs java. If an input file is placed into the folder and the file is run, it should produce the desired output. I tested each one with my own input files that matched the recommended formatting. If you have any questions, please let me know. I know this README is fairly light in what it covers, but I wasn't sure what particularly you wanted here, so please reach out with any questions. Please forgive if any of my github formatting is incorrect as well, as I have not had too much experience using github. Thanks!
